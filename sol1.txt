1. Can algorithms like SMOTE/ROSE which synthesize new examples from the training data be called Generative AI?
    No, algorithms like SMOTE and ROSE which synthesize new examples from the training data cannot be called Generative AI.

Explaination:- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and ROSE (Random Over-Sampling Examples) generate synthetic examples to address class imbalance
in datasets by interpolating existing data points or sampling from a smoothed distribution.
They do not involve learning complex probabilistic models of the data distribution. In contrast, Generative AI, such as GANs and VAEs, learns the underlying data 
distribution to generate entirely new, original data. Therefore, SMOTE and ROSE are data manipulation techniques rather than generative models.
